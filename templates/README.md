# Component Template
This folder contains a template for a new vue component. You can copy `__NAME__` folder to `src/components/` and replace all occurrences of `__NAME__` with component name (including the ones inside files).

While renaming make sure not to rename folders, files, and contents of these. Automatic renaming using IDE might rename the occurrences of `__NAME__` for these as well.
